A self-motivated researcher with a strong technical background in deep learning theories and applications, particularly in natural language processing (NLP). Experienced in developing deep learning models and applying them to NLP and security-critical tasks. Additionally, proficient in hands-on experimentation with large language models (LLMs), focusing on dataset curation, pretraining, finetuning, and building agent-based systems. Versatile in both formal research environments with publications and cutting-edge LLM-driven projects. Highly skilled in PyTorch and Python, with a focus on both deep learning theory and practical applications. My LLM projects can be found on my second [Github account](https://github.com/MeNicefellow) and the LLMs I trained/finetuned and the datasets I curated can be found on my [Huggingface page](https://huggingface.co/DrNicefellow). A 1.7b LLaMa model trained from scratch by me can be found at the [Huggingface collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/McGill-DMaS/dmas-llama-lite-6761d97ba903f82341954ceb).

My Other Hobbies
======
Travelling: I enjoy natural landscapes of the earth. Some dream places for me are Fiji, Caribbean Sea, New Zealand, Austrilia, Alps mountains, Norway, and places like these. 

Photography: I like to record the grandeur of nature with my camera. Take a look at [my portfolio](https://milesqli.github.io/portfolio/). I also enjoy watching other photographers' landscape works on Instagram, Facebook, and 500px.

Reading modern Chinese poem： Xiaosong Gao said "Read poetry or travel: either your body or your soul should be on the way. If your cannot travel, then you can still read poetry." That's right. I like peoms written by Haizi (海子), Beidao (北岛), and Chen Yang (杨晨). I like listenining to Chen Yang's recitation of his own poems and other people's peoms. His voice soothes me of my nostalgia. I also write poems sometimes which are posted in a secret place.

Watching Hayao Miyazaki's cartoon movies: Every time I watch his cartoon movie, I recall the beauty and hope of life. I see the sincere goodwill of some human beings. I feel very fortunate to be able to witness his works.
