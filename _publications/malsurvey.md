Malware detection and classification are becoming more and more challenging, given the complexity of malware design and the recent advancement of communication and computing infrastructure. The existing malware classification approaches enable reverse engineers to better understand their patterns and categorizations, and to cope with their evolution. Moreover, new compositions analysis methods have been proposed to analyze malware samples with the goal of gaining deeper insight on their functionalities and behaviours. This, in turn, helps reverse engineers discern the intent of a malware sample and understand the attackers' objectives. This survey classifies and compares the main findings in malware classification and composition analyses. We also discuss malware evasion techniques and feature extraction methods. Besides, we characterize each reviewed paper on the basis of both algorithms and features used, and highlight its strengths and limitations. We furthermore present issues, challenges, and future research directions related to malware analysis.
